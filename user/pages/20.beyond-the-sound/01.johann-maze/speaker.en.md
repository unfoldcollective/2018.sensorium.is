Johann Maze is a Bordeaux based drummer and percussionist. From calypso to musical improvisation, incorporating noise, ensemble and electronic music - he performs with various artists such as Ãˆlg, France Sauvage, or Lord Rectangle. As a solo performer, he develops dynamic sonic narratives utilizing drums that meet various metallic objects - and this results in a frantic musical performance full of sharp, grinding sounds.
