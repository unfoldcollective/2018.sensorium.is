Saša Spačal is an artist working at the intersection of living systems research, contemporary and sound art. Her work focuses primarily on the posthuman condition in which human beings exist and act as one of many elements in the ecosystem and not as sovereign individuals.

Transversal Is a Loop is a fifty-minute long sound composition and live performance by Saša Spačal that delves into how to think music, sound manipulation and composition - utilizing her dialogue with the crickets Acheta domesticus. The process of making this recording rests on Saša’s years-long research into biological systems through art and science methodologies and physical manifestations in the form of objects and spatial interventions. Her work is thus inextricably linked to critical reflection on the human relation to and impact on biological ecosystems on a planetary, microscopic and energetic level.
