**Thursday 6th June 2019**


This international collective whirls together new music, movement and imagery in an intermedial performance on history´s endless rotation. Everywhen orbits around two sides of life - the personal and the political. An often caring, gentle and well-meaning personal life is contrasted here with the reality of the social individual, who can often be sinister, vengeful and hateful. But how can we be critical to our own worldviews when they are created by those closest to
us?
