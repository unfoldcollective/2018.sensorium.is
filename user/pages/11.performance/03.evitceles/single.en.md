**Saturday 8th June 2019**


Sensorium Club is proud to present Evitceles. Etien Slavchev is a Sofia-based artist hitting the scene of the experimental electronic realm since 2014. He has been putting out several physical releases on respected labels like Opal Tapes,Yerevan Tapes and Seagrave. His deep rippling beats, hazy melodies and obscure samples not only have the potential to drown you in their own special kind of dreamy landscapes, but will surely breathe a new life through loud volume in live environment. Evitceles will perform as part of special commission together with media artist Boris Vitázek - Stix who will be responsible for the visual augmentation of the whole night. Expect fluid semi-transparent images on the verge of crumbling reality and dissolving of physical bodies in the digital realm. 

After smashing ESNS Eurosonic Noorderslag with   his   special  blend   of   futuristic   beats   and  fragile  melodies  Mäss collective boss and SHAPE Platform affiliated artist ISAMA ZING stands out as one of the hot new names bubbling under the surface of European club circuit. Think Arca meets Death Grips on MDMA meets you at Sensorium. Clash magazine says: "The enigmatic and mysterious producer and DJ crafts some of the most forward-thinking, captivating electronica we’ve heard in quite some  time." Us and bunch of other mags including the Independent or Drowned in Sound can only agree to this. ISAMA ZING likes his stage shared, e.g. with Gaika, Lotic, DJ Nigga Fox, Lorn, Greg Fox etc.  His  live shows stand out as  high energy rollercoaster  ride which are not to be missed. 

Rich and eclectic take on fractured techno, bass music and new hybrid club sound will be served by Tea Tralna and Stix.
