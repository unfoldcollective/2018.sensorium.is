**Rachel Uwa (US/DE)**
Founder of School of Machines, Making & Make Believe

School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe was founded by Rachel Uwa. Rachel is an artist, educator, and organizer whose background is in audio engineering and vfx compositing.

Over the past 15+ years sheâ€™s lived in and organized social justice and tech communities and events big and small. She feels compelled to help bring these two worlds together and make the tech world less daunting and more diverse, inclusive, thoughtful, and fun.
Rachel's biggest desire is to see people living the lives they dream of living rather than the one they feel they ought to. If that dream life is more artistic, creative, socially-engaged, technology-embracing and connects humans to each other and to themselves, well, all the better.
