**Irini Papadimitriou (GR/UK)**
Future Everything

Irini Papadimitriou is a curator and cultural manager whose practice draws on interdisciplinary and critical discourse to explore the impact of technology in society and culture, and the role of art in helping us engage with contemporary issues. Her curatorial research areas include technology and ethics, surveillance society, digital citizenship and public (physical-digital) realm.

Even though she currently acts as a Creative Director at FutureEverything, an innovation lab and arts organisation in Manchester, she previously worked as a Digital Programmes Manager and Head of New Media Arts Development at Watermans, curating their exhibitions programme.

She also has experience as a co-curator for the Arts & Culture experience at Mozilla Festival and she is co-founder of Maker Assembly, a critical gathering about maker culture. She is an IWM Institute Associate and has been a recipient of curatorial research programmes including MOBIUS (Finnish Institute), Art Fund, Mondriaan Fonds and British Council. She has served as a jury member for Ars Electronica, Lumen Prize, EU STARTS and ACM Siggraph.

Her display, Artificially Intelligent, was exhibited at the V&A in 2018.
