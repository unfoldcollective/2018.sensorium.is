New media artist and creative coder from Barcelona. She focuses her practice in code, electronics and non-digital objects for creating interactive projects often framed as experimental games, which aim to go beyond the game itself. Her interest lies in the social impact of technology, human-machine coexistence and the reappropriation of technological systems and devices, to manipulate and rethink them through art. From educational approaches to sociological experimentations, she proposes new ways of thinking and interacting with the digital environment that surrounds us. 

She has participated in different festivals such Ars Electronica, Japan Media Arts Festival, FILE Festival or Sónar, among others, and done residences in TAG Montreal, QUTThe Cube (Brisbane) and at Ars Electronica Futurelab. Currently she is working on a research project about robots, AI and social interactions with a Leonardo grant from BBVA Foundation.
