Evelyn Benčičová (SK/DE) is a visual creator specialising in photography and art direction. With knowledge and experience based on fine art and new media studies ([University for Applied Arts](https://www.dieangewandte.at), Vienna), Evelyn’s work combines her interest in contemporary culture with academic research to create a unique aesthetic space in which the conceptual meets the visual.

Her collaboration repertoire includes cultural institutions such as [Frieze](https://frieze.com/), [Royal Opera House](https://www.roh.org.uk/), [Berghain](
www.berghain.berlin), [Kunsthalle Basel](http://www.kunsthallebasel.ch), [National Portrait Gallery](http://www.npg.org.uk) and [MQ Vienna](www.mqw.at). Evelyn's work was published in internationally released art books and exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. She also received numerous awards for both photography and art-direction including [Hasselblad Masters](https://www.hasselblad.com/masters/).

In 2019, Evelyn completed artistic residency in [Mimic Studio](https://www.mimicproductions.com/) which shifted her practice into more immersive and experimental forms of story-telling. Audio-visual work “[Next time die consciously](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2629850343721470)” (2018) and “[nine sum-sorcery](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=642362259607325)” (2019) were premiered on the main stage of [Atonal Berlin](https://berlin-atonal.com/), [MIRA](https://mirafestival.com/en/) (Barcelona) and Regenerations (Amsterdam). VR installation “Artificial Tears” was exhibited at [Berlin Photo Week](https://www.berlinphotoweek.com/allevents/the-exhibition) in Kraftwerk and Synthesis Gallery (Berlin).
