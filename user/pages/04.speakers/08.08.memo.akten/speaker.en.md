**Memo Akten (TUR/US)**
Media Artist

Memo Akten is an ever inspiring artist, musician, researcher, curious mind and philomath who works with computation as a medium and language to investigate the collisions between nature, science, technology, ethics, ritual, tradition and religion; reflecting the intersection of science and spirituality. He is finishing a PhD in artificial intelligence/machine learning focusing on expressive human-machine interaction at Goldsmiths UoL, attempting to deepen collaborative creativity between humans and machines and augment human creative expression. 

Memo Akten received the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica in 2013 for his collaboration with David Quayola, »Forms«. Since 2009 his works »Body Paint« and »Gold« have toured with the Victoria & Albert Museum’s »Decode« exhibition, and in 2014, his work as Marshmallow Laser Feast »Laser Forest« was part of the Barbican’s »Digital Revolutions« exhibition. His other exhibition and performance locations include the Grand Palais (Paris FR), Royal Opera House (London UK), Moscow Museum of Modern Art (Moscow RU), Holon Museum (Tel Aviv IL), EYE Film Institute (Amsterdam NL) and Lisbon Architecture Triennale (Lisbon PT).
