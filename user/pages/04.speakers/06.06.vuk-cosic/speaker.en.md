**Vuk Ćosić (SI)**
Artist & Hacker

Vuk is one of the original Net.artists who has been active, exhibited and published since 1994, and also a co-founder of Nettime, Syndicate, 7-11 and the Ljubljana Digital Medialab - international forums for internet criticism, theory and art. This curious artist with Balkan roots is a one-of-a-kind "hacker of ideas". His constantly evolving oeuvre is characterized by an interesting mix of philosophical, political, and conceptual network-related issues on the one hand, and an innovative feeling for contemporary urban and underground aesthetics on the other.

Ćosić became deeply interested in ASCII code during a long period of research (1996–2001) of low-tech aesthetics, the economy, ecology and archaeology of the media. The most notable venues of his exhibitions, among many others, include Videotage, Hong Kong; Media Artlab, Tel Aviv; Venice Biennial; MIT Medialab; Walker Center, Minneapolis; Postmasters, NYC; Kunsthalle, Vienna; LAMoCA, Los Angeles; ICA, London and Beaubourg, Paris.
