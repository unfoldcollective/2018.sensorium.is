Lukas Truniger is a Swiss media artist and electronic musician who engages in the world of multimedia installations, performances and creation of new musical instruments. He is fascinated by all of the intangible, invisible and complex in nature, and his interests include everything from biological interactions and processes, to various manifestations of human society - language, (artificial) intelligence or human infrastructures. For the exploration and re-appropriation of their inseparable aesthetics, he applies self-made code, misused tools and various materials in attempts to create experiences challenging the modalities of our perception.

Experience his machine-like installation [Ethereal Fleeting](http://sensorium.is/beyond-the-sound/ethereal-fleeting) in the Sensorium Beyond The Sound garden from Friday 12th until Sunday 14th of June. Garden opening times are always 10:00 - 18:00.
