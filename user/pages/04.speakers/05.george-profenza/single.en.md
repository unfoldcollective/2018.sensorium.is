Creative Technologist, most-of-the-time socially functioning nerd, all round fix-it-code-champion and chaser of rabbit holes.

The day-to-day maker of interactive magic at [Hirsch & Mann](https://www.hirschandmann.com), bridging designers’ vision with engineers’ realities. George’s specialisations lie in computer vision, interfacing between firmware and software, and real-time computer graphics. A graduate of Goldsmiths Creative Computing and the Bartlett’s Architecture + Computation, George is interested in how art, design and technology intersect to create unique works that are fun, curious and engaging. He believes that rich and unexpected outcomes are the result of a hybrid approach that embraces analytical precision, hands-on experimentation, and a good dose of fearless hacker enthusiasm.

George spends his spare time bringing robots and puppets to life and finding artistic inspiration in paper folding, doodling and complex geometry.
