Johann Maze is a Bordeaux based drummer and percussionist. From calypso to musical improvisation, incorporating noise, ensemble and electronic music - he performs with various artists such as Ãˆlg, France Sauvage, or Lord Rectangle. As a solo performer, he develops dynamic sonic narratives utilizing drums that meet various metallic objects - and this results in a frantic musical performance full of sharp, grinding sounds.

Experience site-specific [performance of Johann Maze](http://sensorium.is/beyond-the-sound/performance-johann-maze) in the Sensorium Beyond The Sound garden on Sunday 14th June at 14:00 - 16:00.
