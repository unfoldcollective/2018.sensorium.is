**Evelyn Benčičová (SK/DE)**
Visual Artist          

Evelyn Bencicova (born in Bratislava, 1992) is a visual creator specialising in photography and art direction. With knowledge and experience based on fine art and new media studies (University for Applied Arts, Vienna), Evelyn’s work combines her interest in contemporary culture with academic research to create a unique aesthetic space in which the conceptual meets the visual.

Her collaboration repertoire includes cultural institutions such as Frieze, Royal Opera House, Berghain, Kunsthalle Basel, National Portrait Gallery and MQ Vienna. Evelyn's work was published in internationally released art books and exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. She also received numerous awards for both photography and art-direction including Hasselblad Masters.

In 2019, Evelyn completed artistic residency in Mimic Studio which shifted her practice into more immersive and experimental forms of story-telling. Audio-visual work “Next time die consciously” (2018) and “nine sum-sorcery” (2019) were premiered on the main stage of Atonal Berlin, MIRA (Barcelona) and Regenerations (Amsterdam). VR installation “Artificial Tears” was exhibited at Berlin Photo Week in Kraftwerk and Synthesis Gallery (Berlin).
