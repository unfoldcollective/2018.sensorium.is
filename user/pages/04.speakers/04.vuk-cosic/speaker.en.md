Vuk Ćosić is one of the original Net.artists who has been active, exhibited and published since 1994, and also a co-founder of [Nettime](https://nettime.org/), Syndicate, 7-11 and the [Ljubljana Digital Medialab](https://wiki.ljudmila.org/Naslovnica) - international forums for internet criticism, theory and art. This curious artist with balkan roots is a one-of-a-kind "hacker of ideas". His constantly evolving oeuvre is characterized by an interesting mix of philosophical, political, and conceptual network-related issues on the one hand, and an innovative feeling for contemporary urban and underground aesthetics on the other.

Ćosić became deeply interested in ASCII code during a long period of research (1996–2001) of low-tech aesthetics, the economy, ecology and archaeology of the media. The most notable venues of his exhibitions, among many others, include [Videotage](http://videotage.org.hk/web/), Hong Kong; Media Artlab, Tel Aviv; [Venice Biennial](https://www.labiennale.org/en); [MIT Medialab](https://www.media.mit.edu/); [Walker Center](https://www.walkerctr.org/), Minneapolis; [Postmasters](http://www.postmastersart.com/), NYC; [Kunsthalle](https://kunsthallewien.at/en/), Vienna; [LAMoCA](https://www.moca.org/), Los Angeles; [ICA](https://www.ica.art/), London and [Beaubourg](https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en), Paris.
