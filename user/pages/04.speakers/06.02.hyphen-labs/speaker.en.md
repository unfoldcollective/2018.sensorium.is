**Carmen Aguilar y Wedge ** (MX/USA) is Co-founder and Creative Director at Hyphen-Labs. Inspired by the translation of concepts to material expressions Carmen creates experiences physicalised and visualised through an aesthetic framework of science fiction, futurism, and surrealism. Drawing on her background in structural engineering and design she uses emerging technology to expand on the principles of emotional and planetary-centred design.

**Romy Gad el Rab** (EG/UK) is Design Researcher and Creative Producer at Hyphen-Labs. Egyptian-Scottish Designer and clinical psychiatrist. Interested in the condition of the human mind and how narratives told through new media art can shape cognition. 

**Hyphen Labs** (UK) is a London based design studio and an international collective exploring absurdities that emerge at the intersection of technology, art, science, and the future. It uses design to challenge conventions and stimulate conversations, placing planetary needs and collective experiences at the centre of their current evolving narratives.
