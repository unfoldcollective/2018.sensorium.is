Corentin Vignet is a French artist. Inspired by the urban landscape, he transforms it to bring it to life. After one year at Beaux Arts de Paris and graduating from ECAL, his work combines installation with interaction. Between bulky and recovered objects, he invites the public to interact with them. Through his creativity and technology, he awakens the soul of everyday objects.
