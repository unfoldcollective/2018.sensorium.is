Dear friends, 

**UPDATED on 15.7.2020**


We hope you are safe and taking care of yourself and the people around you. At the end of last year, when we chose our theme for Sensorium 2020, we did not expect how much, how soon we would need this NEW SENSIBILITY. 

We fear for our health, for the health of our loved ones, for our economic situation, for the society we live in. But we also get the feeling that we are experiencing something unique, a major challenge to everything we have been used to. We feel that we need to remain attentive, stay focused, and trust that we will adapt. We need to learn new ways to connect to each other, to our environment, to our beliefs and ways of being. We need to rethink our ability to experience uncertainty. We need to develop - **[new sensibility](https://sensorium.is/new-sensibility)**. 

At Sensorium we believe in the power of you - our creative community to see beyond the obvious. We believe, that together we will be able to re-create the unique experience of intimate connection that we yearly orchestrate for you and with you.

Although we would love to see all of you from all corners of the world as it usually happens during Sensorium Festival, the situation we are living in is extremely unpredictable and unstable. It is extremely difficult for us as organisers to plan, especially international activities and therefore we adjusted the [programme](https://sensorium.is/#programme) format to serve mainly local audiences in the period of **19th August to 7th of September** this year with **two online meetups** that are possible to join from anywhere. Please let us know to hello@sensorium.is if you would like to join us in any form from abroad and we will look for possibilities.


Entry to this programme except of the [Design Ethics Workshop](https://sensorium.is/#programme) is for a voluntary contribution. You can get a **refund** of your ticket through the confirmation email that you received after purchasing. In case of any problems contact hello@sensorium.is. We will also be grateful if you **support us by symbolically keeping your Sensorium 2020 ticket**. Thank you for being with us.


Our website will always the most accurate programme presentation but follow our social media for any quick updates.

**Meanwhile, stockpile some food for thought with us:**

To stay in touch in times and social distancing, to gather our ideas and to contribute what inspires us, we decided to launch a weekly format bringing voices from our community to reflect on the current pandemic situation and its potential implications. Stockpiling Food For Thought - the Sensorium Quarantine Weekly Special will brought you one interview with an inspiring artist, curator or thinker from the area of digital arts and culture every Sunday morning. Due to being very busy with organising all the festival events, we had to stop the articles, but we will be preparing a mini-publication in the fall of 2020.

Wishing you lots of strenght.
