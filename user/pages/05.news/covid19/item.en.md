Dear friends, 

We hope you are safe and taking care of yourself and the people around you. At the end of last year, when we chose our theme for Sensorium 2020, we did not expect how much, how soon we would need this NEW SENSIBILITY. 

We fear for our health, for the health of our loved ones, for our economic situation, for the society we live in. But we also get the feeling that we are experiencing something unique, a major challenge to everything we have been used to. We feel that we need to remain attentive, stay focused, and trust that we will adapt. We need to learn new ways to connect to each other, to our environment, to our beliefs and ways of being. We need to rethink our ability to experience uncertainty. We need to develop - **[new sensibility](https://sensorium.is/new-sensibility)**. 

At Sensorium we believe in the power of you - our creative community to see beyond the obvious. We believe, that together we will be able to re-create the unique experience of intimate connection that we yearly orchestrate for you and with you.

Like everybody else, we do not know what will really happen in the following months and trying to plan is like trying to be a fortuneteller with a milky glass ball. We are continuing preparations for the festival in postponed dates - **28th till 30th August 2020**. Although we wish and hope to meet you all in your full physicality, we are also doing lots of research on a plan B - hybrid online-offline version. We are looking at best practices and partnering up with experienced organisations and talking to other festivals and experts.

We promise to inform you as soon as we can about any changes to the programme or locations. Our website will always the most accurate programme presentation but follow our social media for any quick updates.

**Meanwhile, stockpile some food for thought with us:**

To stay in touch in times and social distancing, to gather our ideas and to contribute what inspires us, we decided to launch a weekly format bringing voices from our community to reflect on the current pandemic situation and its potential implications. Stockpiling Food For Thought - the Sensorium Quarantine Weekly Special will bring you one interview with an inspiring artist, curator or thinker from the area of digital arts and culture every Sunday morning at 10AM CET.

Wishing you lots of strenght into the following weeks.

Sensorium Festival Team
