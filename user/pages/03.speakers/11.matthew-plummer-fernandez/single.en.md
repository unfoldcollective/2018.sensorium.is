Matthew Plummer Fernandez is a British/Colombian artist who creates sculpture, software, online interventions, and installations, often producing and reflecting on contemporary social and computational entanglements. He received an MA from the Royal College of Art, 2009 and is completing a practice-based doctorate at Goldsmiths, University of London. He runs the popular blog [Algopop](https://algopop.tumblr.com/) on algorithms in every day life. His work has been presented extensively, including solo shows at iMal in collaboration with JODI, and Nome Gallery in Berlin. His works have been acquired by the Pompidou in Paris, commissioned by the [V&A](https://www.vam.ac.uk/) in London, and [AND Festival](https://www.andfestival.org.uk/), Manchester. He is currently represented by [Nome Gallery](https://nomegallery.com/) and is an invited resident at [Somerset House Studios](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/somerset-house-studios).

Sensorium Festival presents a selection of Matthew’s work in the 'Augmented Authorship' exhibition at Satelit Gallery, Bratislava 10.4. - 8.6. 2019. The point of departure for this exhibition has been the intersection of the designer’s current research focus and the 2019 theme of Sensorium Festival ‘The Augmented Mind’. In both his PhD research and his own creative practice, Plummer Fernandez explores contemporary socio-technical entanglements with software automation.

A central line in Plummer Fernandez’ investigation considers authorship under the influence of computational processes and automated (re)assembly. In this exhibition concept we’d like to place this work in the light of augmentation as a design principle and explore how contemporary computational design practices can facilitate new forms of authorship. These practices have also informed the exhibition design itself.
