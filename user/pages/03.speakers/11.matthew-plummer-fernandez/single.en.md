Matthew Plummer Fernandez is a British/Colombian artist that creates sculpture, software, online interventions, and installations, often in connection, producing and reflecting on contemporary social and computational entanglements and configurations. He received an MA from the Royal College of Art, 2009 and is completing a practice-based doctorate at Goldsmiths, University of London. He runs the popular blog Algopopon algorithms in every day life. His work has been presented extensively, including solo shows at iMal in collaboration with JODI, and Nome Gallery in Berlin. His works have been acquired by the Pompidou in Paris, and commissioned by the V&A in London, and AND Festival, Manchester. He is currently represented by Nome Gallery and is an invited resident at Somerset House Studios.

Sensorium Festival presents selection of Matthew’s work in an exhibition Augmented Authorship in Satelit Gallery, Bratislava 10.4. - 8.6. 2019. You can meet Matthew at the vernissage 10.4.2019 in Satelit Gallery.
Through this exhibition Sensorium Festival invited the designer and artist Matthew Plummer Fernandez to let his work and current research inhabit the Satelit gallery.

The point of departure for this exhibition has been the intersection of the designer’s
current research focus and the 2019 theme of Sensorium Festival ‘The Augmented
Mind’. In both his PhD research and his own creative practice, Plummer Fernandez
explores contemporary socio-technical entanglements with software automation.

A central line in Plummer Fernandez’ investigation considers authorship under the
influence of computational processes and automated (re)assembly. In this exhibition
concept we’d like to place this work in the light of augmentation as a design principle and explore how contemporary computational design practices can facilitate new forms of authorship.  

The exhibition design itself has embraced these practices by letting an algorithm place the exhibits into the space of the gallery.
