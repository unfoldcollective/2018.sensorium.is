Elliot Woods is a digital media artist from Manchester, UK. He graduated with a Masters from the School of Physics and Astronomy and entered the arts following the founding of studio Kimchi and Chips in 2009 where he currently tests alternative relationships between images and reality. Here he participates in conceptual and technical design of projects, and develops techniques in computer vision, machine learning and robotics. His works reveal the implicit nature of systems therein suggesting to audiences revelatory experiences about nature and reality. He has created large scale light field art installations which draw floating images of the sun out of sunlight, or moons from 600 calibrated projector beams. Elliot has contributed to the openFrameworks and VVVV creative coding platforms and has released over 100 open source libraries for free on GitHub.
