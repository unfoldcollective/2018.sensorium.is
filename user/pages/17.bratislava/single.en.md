**About Pistori Palace**

It was Felix Pisztory, a pharmacist of Jewish origin, who built the palace in the eclectic style in the 1890s at a city boulevard that was just being built at that time. Aside from this place, Pisztory also owned the historical house with the Red Crayfish Pharmacy, which now houses a museum of pharmacy, in the Old Town. Part of the palace’s premises was a garden stretching up to what is today the Slavín monument. Pisztory grew herbs there for his medicaments.

Pisztory, however, did not live long enough to see the palace completed, as he died in 1891. During the Second World War it was the seat of the embassy of Nazi Germany. It was exactly at this place that decisions were made about transports of Slovak Jews, or the way to suppress the Slovak National Uprising. After the war the palace was nationalised and fell under state ownership. Then the Museum of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was launched in 1952. In recent times, a slightly larger-than-life statue recalled this part of the history of the palace.

The building became a protected national cultural monument in 1963.

After the Velvet Revolution and the fall of the totalitarian communist regime in 1989, the museum lost justification for its existence and part of the premises was used by the House of Foreign Slovaks. This organisation was the last tenant in the palace for numerous years. Afterwards, the building stood vacant for 12 years and in disrepair, as the Old City did not have the money for its reconstruction.
