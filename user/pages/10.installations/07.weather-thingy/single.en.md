This project is using real time climate-related events to control and modify the settings of musical instruments. Through this project Adrien wanted to propose a new way of composing and playing music by letting nature accompany us in our melodies. This project joins in a serie of sound modules that he has made to find a new way to compose and collaborate with environmental events.
