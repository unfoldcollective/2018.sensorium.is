Sound as an informational source is described in terms of auditory attributes, such as timbre, tone, pitch, duration, loudness. These characteristics are analyzed and give relevance to the delivery of musical meaning. But sound is not only about deduced meaning. It is about physical energy shared. Sound as a vibrational force links humans bodies and matter at a material level, via physical resonation. Human beings perceive sound, either when it is heard by entering the ear canal or when corporeally experienced. It is on and in our body that acoustic waves become discernible.

Phase In, Phase Out is the result of an art-based study on the crossmodal, employing sound, textile and space as one unified medium. By augmenting textile into a multi channel electroacoustic transducer, EJTECH explores the “alogogenic” properties of sound via the unique timbre of textile, through sound pieces or “electronic poems” specifically written for, and performed on a purely textile-sound system.
