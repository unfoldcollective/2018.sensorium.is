"plug your nose and try to hum" is a Virtual Reality installation by Martina Menegon in which the user is surrounded by floating miniature bodies that can be hit, grabbed, stretched and tossed around. Using the controllers, that also function as light sources, it is possible to freely interact with the artist’s 3d scanned body that randomly spawns around the scene, humming in various pitches. These virtual bodies propose a synthetic corporeality, evoking a sense of uncanniness due to the blurring of the split between real and virtual, flesh and data. They are perceivable digital representation, something that can be sensed and felt despite their virtual nature.
