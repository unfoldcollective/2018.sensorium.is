“Light them all” is a multiplayer game taking place in an interactive installation composed of lamps, projection mapping and a mobile web application. 
When users connect with their mobile phone, a light source that they can control in the installation appears in projection. 

This ball of light turns on each of the physical lamps it touches for a limited time. When a lamp come on, it’s lampshade filters the light, thus recomposing the map.
