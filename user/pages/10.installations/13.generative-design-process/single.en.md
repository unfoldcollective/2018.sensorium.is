Inspired by nature and made possible by technology, generative design is an example of augmenting traditional human creativity with the possibilities of modern computing systems.
<br>
The 3D Printed Steering Wheel project was focused on exploring and demonstrating the possibilities for various generative methods in the design of a specific product - a steering wheel. The premise was the use of multimaterial 3D printing in production of mass-personalized products.
<br>
The project was created within a doctoral study at the Institute of Industrial Design at FA STU in Bratislava. It was supported by [VW Group Future Center Europ](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2018/05/never-forget-the-users.html)e. The objects were largely created in Grasshopper, with add-ons like Millipede, Anemone and Cocoon.
