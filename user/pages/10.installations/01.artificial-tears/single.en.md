This immersive piece from a multi-award winning Slovak visual artist [Evelyn Benčičová](https://sensorium.is/speakers/01.evelyn-bencicova) depicts the moment of uncertainty, an alienation in most ordinary state of performing a stereotypical (act or given) task. Hosted in the atrium of Slovak National Gallery it is an opportunity to plunge into new realities of your senses.


Vision of the future elegant and clean, reality being just a blank canvas on which we project. Nothingness of the world you see suggests, that everything is happening inside, in the mind, process(or) of thinking. Main character takes female appearance based on wrong perfection and stereotype. It represents the woman designed (by others or herself) to satisfy general definition and expectations of her kind. Who is it?


This model is Everybody. It is you as it is me. But also none of us. It is the other, your double. It is a feeling of an outsider in strange world. Forced adaptivity to absurd rule. It is nonsense.


The glimpse of second when the pattern gets broken and the meaning or more exactly the meaninglessness of ones own action is revealed. It does not necessarily shows the future where machine acts like human but rather, or at the same time the world in which human acts like an automaton.
In the VR experience of Artificial Tears the multi-layered character finally comes to life by discovering its own power to change.
