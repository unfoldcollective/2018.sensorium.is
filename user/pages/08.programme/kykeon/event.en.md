Kykeon is an immersive virtual reality experience by slovak media artist [Mária Júdová](https://sensorium.is/speakers/maria-judova) exploring shamanism as a way to reimagine our current society. Inspired by ancestral knowledge and wisdom, it invites the audience to take a part in a new ritual. You will have a chance to look into a hidden realm through the eyes of a shaman. Entering the virtual world inhabited by spirit beings, celestial mechanics and forgotten harmonics.
