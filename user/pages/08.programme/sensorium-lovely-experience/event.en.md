Mini conference on art, design, science and technology in partnership with [Lovely Experience](http://lovelyexperience.sk/) festival in Trnava opens up the theme of [New Sensibility](https://sensorium.is/new-sensibility) - new sense of the post-digital age. Technology changed our life in a way which we are not familiar with. Society is experiencing many symptoms of the digital revolution directly, without warning. effects of digitalisation and possible technocracy are different than our (missing) visions about them.

We have invited [Irini Papadimitriou](https://sensorium.is/speakers/07.irini-papadimitriou), curator and cultural manager whose practice draws on interdisciplinary and critical discourse to explore the impact of technology in society and culture, and the role of art in helping us engage with contemporary issues. Her curatorial research areas include technology and ethics, surveillance society, digital citizenship and public (physical-digital) realm. Irini will guide us through the topics of systems of control and in particular architecture of algorithmic systems and aesthetics of automation (exploring hidden labour, reinforcement of racial and gendered structures). Even though she currently acts as a Creative Director at [FutureEverything](http://www.futureeverything.org), an innovation lab and arts organisation in Manchester, she previously worked as a Digital Programmes Manager and Head of New Media Arts Development at Watermans, curating their exhibitions programme.

Another guest, astrobiologist Michaela Musilová, will open topics such as possibilities of extraterrestrial living and the importance of empathy during crisis situations. Michaela is a director of HI-SEAS project and the International Moonbase Alliance testing life on Mars and the Moon. Tactical Tech will join the conversation. This Berlin based NGO is working in the area of privacy and personal data protection.
