Mini conference on art, design, science and technology in partnership with [Garden - Center for Independent Culture](https://zahradacnk.sk/) in Banská Bystrica opens up the theme of [New Sensibility](https://sensorium.is/new-sensibility) - new sense of the post-digital age. Technology changed our life in a way which we are not familiar with. Society is experiencing many symptoms of the digital revolution directly, without warning. effects of digitalisation and possible technocracy are different than our (missing) visions about them.

Our special guest will be  [Rachel Uwa](https://sensorium.is/speakers/rachel-uwa), founder of the [School of Machines, Making & Make Believe](http://www.schoolofma.org). This non-formal education organisation combines technology, art and design as well as other disciplines and is a fresh holder of Pris Ars Electronica for Digital Communities. Rachel will tune us into rethinking technology, society, and self and expand on what does one have to do with the other anyway...

Over the past 15+ years she’s lived in and organized social justice and tech communities and events big and small. She feels compelled to help bring these two worlds together and make the tech world less daunting and more diverse, inclusive, thoughtful, and fun. 

Local scene will be represented by [Mária Júdová](https://sensorium.is/speakers/maria-judova), international visual artist who has been investigating the creative potential of technology for over a decade. She is particularly interested in exploring the meeting point of digital and performance arts. Her work spans from (interactive) installations and Virtual Reality experiences to audio-visual performances.
