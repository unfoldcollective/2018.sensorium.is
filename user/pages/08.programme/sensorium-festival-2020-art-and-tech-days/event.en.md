Mini conference on art, design, science and technology in partnership with [Art & Tech Days](https://atdays.sk/) in Košice opens up the theme of [New Sensibility](https://sensorium.is/new-sensibility) - new sense of the post-digital age. Technology changed our life in a way which we are not familiar with. Society is experiencing many symptoms of the digital revolution directly, without warning. effects of digitalisation and possible technocracy are different than our (missing) visions about them.

[Hyphen Labs](https://sensorium.is/speakers/02.hyphen-labs) (UK) is a London based design studio and an international collective exploring absurdities that emerge at the intersection of technology, art, science, and the future. It uses design to challenge conventions and stimulate conversations, placing planetary needs and collective experiences at the centre of their current evolving narratives. Their creative director Carmen Aguilar y Wedge (USA/MX) and design researcher Romy Gad el Rab (EG/UK) are the main actors of this multicultural female collective. Through their projects, they will take you on a journey through the wildest imaginations about the future. 

Local scene will be represented by an artist, essayist and cultural manager Samuel Velebný. In his project Road to Quatar, Samuel thematizes global socio-economic contexts of the so-called “Media sport”, network of relationships on the background of the soccer industry. The involvement of media technology into the world of soccer is not only an augmentation of soccer into the world but also meaning of the world soccer itself - originally a physical game with certain meaning for communities has become a global media commodity and a tool for geopolitical fight. The dessert world championships in Quatar in 2022 are a cruel outfall of this turnover.
