In this 4-hour workshop, we will explore design ethics. "Design ethics" is a term which often feels quite nebulous and intangible--after all, how can you apply it to your everyday work? The workshop will be beneficial especially for UX and UI designers, developers, or other parties working with technology including project managers. We will first evaluate a number of examples of weaponized design. Then, together we will concretely apply and test out tools and methods for critical design thinking on a number of real life app examples. After the workshop, you can take these tools and methods and apply them to your everyday work. The workshop will be in english language.
