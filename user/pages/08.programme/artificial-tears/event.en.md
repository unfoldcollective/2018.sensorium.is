This immersive piece from a multi-award winning Slovak visual artist [Evelyn Benčičová](https://sensorium.is/speakers/01.evelyn-bencicova) depicts the moment of uncertainty, an alienation in most ordinary state of performing a stereotypical task. Hosted in the atrium of Slovak National Gallery it is an opportunity to plunge into new realities of your senses.
