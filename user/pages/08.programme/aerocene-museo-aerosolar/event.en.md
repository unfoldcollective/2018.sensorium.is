Museo Aero Solar  is a participative flying structure constructed out of hundreds of plastic bags collected from local inhabitants. Realised thanks to the activist community of artist Tomás Saraceno called Aerocene devising new modes of sensitivity, reactivating a common imaginary towards an ethical collaboration with the environment and the atmosphere, free from carbon emissions. Bratislava will join 21 locations that will fly a Tetro in order to add our voices to the Aerocene [manifesto](https://aerocene.org/about_2020/).

Help us **collect plastic bags** by bringing yours to the container in front of BKIS at Židovská 1 by **20th August 2020** and join the build on Sunday 30th August at a  special location in Bratislava by subscribing to production@sensorium.is.
