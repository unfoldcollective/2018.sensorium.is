Mini conference on art, design, science and technology in partnership with The International Festival of Animated Film [Fest Anča](http://festanca.sk/) in Žilina opens up the theme of [New Sensibility](https://sensorium.is/new-sensibility) - new sense of the post-digital age. Technology changed our life in a way which we are not familiar with. Society is experiencing many symptoms of the digital revolution directly, without warning. effects of digitalisation and possible technocracy are different than our (missing) visions about them.

When it comes to creativity, technology can be an integrated part of an artwork or on the other hand it can be used simply as a tool for creation. Main guests of the mini conference will be Ferdi Alici and Eylul Duranagac from [OUCHHH](https://sensorium.is/speakers/05.ferdi-aici-&-eylul-duranagac) - an award winning independent creative new media studio with cross-discipline expertise in Art - Science - Technology. Ouchhh is considered to be a multidisciplinary creative hub focused on interactive new media platforms, artificial intelligence, data-driven sculptures & paintings, kinetic public arts and immersive experiences. 

From the local scene the event will present successful illustrator and author of numerous brand identities, Ivana Palečková. Besides the identity for Fest Anča 2018 she is an author of multiple successful designs for new businesses and projects. Ivana is also an author of multiple photo-publications.
