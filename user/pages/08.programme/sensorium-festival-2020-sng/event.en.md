Hybrid mini conference on art, design, science and technology in partnership with the Slovak National Gallery opens up the theme of [New Sensibility](https://sensorium.is/new-sensibility) - new sense of the post-digital age. Technology changed our life in a way which we are not familiar with. Society is experiencing many symptoms of the digital revolution directly, without warning. effects of digitalisation and possible technocracy are different than our (missing) visions about them.

The evening will be opened by Lucia Stach Gregorová, contemporary art curator at SNG who will introduce New Sensibility in the context of fine arts. Freya Murray, Creative Lead at Google Arts & Culture will in her online talk walk us through ideas and visions on mediation of artistic content to future audiences. As part of the mini conference we will open up a VR installation of Evelyn Benčičová Artificial Tears in the atrium of SNG. Evelyn as our special guest will also introduce a wider context of her current practice in the field of new media.
