46th edition of PechaKucha Night Bratislava in collaboration with festival of digital arts Sensorium 2020 will address the theme of New Sensibility - new sense of post-digital era. It will focus on questions related to redefinition of our relationship with technology, environment but also our personal relationships. Our interest will also lie in the possibilities of how to perceive our digital future, how to build awareness and trust in it. While exploring different aspects of our lives connected through technology, we will look through the creative lens of our guests - artists, designers, architects, experts as well as thinkers of slovak and czech scene.
