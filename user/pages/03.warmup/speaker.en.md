#### STUART NOLAN: 1000 MINDREADERS

One Thousand Mindreaders is a year-long artwork for 2018 by Stuart Nolan during which he will train 1000 new mindreaders. In this interactive session, we will explore the role of touch in interaction, learning to read each other’s minds using techniques based on Victorian mindreading tricks, games, and experiments, and improved with current research into the neuroscience of touch. You will learn how duplicate drawings another person is thinking of and to find objects they have hidden. Stuart will give a brief insight into his recent work on touch in healthcare, theatre, dance, sport, robotics, and 5G and we will explore the potential of technology to capture, measure, and transmit touch data in mediated communication, interaction, art, and storytelling. 

#### STUART NOLAN

is a Research Magician with a background in cell biology, interactive media, experience design, programming, technology development, academic research, and playful & performative facilitation. He works with traditional sleight-of-hand conjuring, psychological illusion, memory feats, performance poetry, sideshow tradition, storytelling, and bespoke technology. A former NESTA Fellow in Applied Magic he is credited with bringing the study of deception out of the lab and into the everyday world by combining traditional disciplines of deception with original research into how we are deceived by language and physical gesture.

His current project is 1000 mindreaders - Participants will learn the skill of muscle reading, sensing the small subconscious movements of another person’s hands. This will enable them to recreate drawings that another person is merely thinking of. They will also learn how to find objects that another person has hidden in a room or building. Both the drawings and the found objects will be exhibited in 2019.
